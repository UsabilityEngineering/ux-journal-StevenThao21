# Monitor - User experience 

I recently purchased the Pixio PX222 22-inch FHD 1080p Gaming Monitor as an affordable upgrade for casual gaming and everyday use. My initial impressions were positiveâ€”the display quality was sharp, with vibrant colors and smooth motion at the 75Hz refresh rate. However, as I began setting up the monitor, I encountered some design challenges that significantly impacted my overall experience.

One of the most notable issues was the orientation of the ports. All the ports, including the HDMI and VGA inputs, are pointed downward, which made connecting cables a frustrating task. This design choice felt inconvenient, especially when using the included stand. The downward ports forced me to awkwardly maneuver cables at an angle, increasing the risk of bending both the ports and the cables. This caused unnecessary concern about potential long-term damage.

The stand itself was another drawback. While it was easy enough to assemble, the lack of adjustability was disappointing. The stand only supports a fixed tilt, and unfortunately, this resulted in the screen leaning slightly forward. This awkward angle made prolonged use uncomfortable and required some makeshift solutions to prop up the monitor to a more ergonomic position. For a product marketed towards gamers, where comfortable viewing is crucial, this felt like a missed opportunity.
