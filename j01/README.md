# Monitor - User experience

I recently purchased the Pixio PX222 22-inch FHD 1080p Gaming Monitor as an affordable replacement monitor for casual gaming and everyday use. My initial impressions were positive, the display quality was decent for the price. However, as I began setting up the monitor, I encountered some design challenges that significantly impacted my overall experience.

One of the most notable issues was the orientation of the ports. All the ports, including the HDMI and VGA inputs, are pointed downward, which makes connecting cables frustrating. This design choice feels inconvenient, especially when using the included stand. The downward ports forced me to maneuver cables awkwardly at an angle, increasing the risk of bending both the ports and the wires. This causes unnecessary concern about potential long-term damage.

The stand itself was another drawback. While it was easy enough to assemble, the lack of adjustability was disappointing. The stand only supports a fixed tilt, and unfortunately, this resulted in the screen leaning slightly forward. This awkward angle made prolonged use uncomfortable and required some makeshift solutions to prop up the monitor to a more ergonomic position. For a product marketed towards gamers, where comfortable viewing is crucial, this felt like a missed opportunity.

Overall, while the Pixio PX222 delivers where it counts regarding display quality, the poorly designed stand and downward-facing ports create significant usability challenges. For users considering this monitor, I would highly recommend investing in a third-party stand or wall mount to make the experience more comfortable and practical. Additionally, investing in some 90-degree port adapters can help prevent cable bending and damage.
